## Overview

# Positioning

## Problem statement

The challenge of vendor-specific serverless computing impacts software developers significantly. This issue necessitates developers to familiarize themselves with distinct systems for various cloud platforms, raising the risk of vendor lock-in. An effective solution would entail a system deployable on any cloud provider or on-premises infrastructure, delivering a consistent interface for developers.

## Product position statement

For developers unfamiliar with DevOps practices, the Kaos project offers an open-source platform that simplifies and standardizes the deployment of their applications or functions. In contrast to major cloud providers, this project is entirely free and open-source, compatible with any Kubernetes cluster.

## Business opportunity

Creating an open-source platform presents the opportunity to foster community collaboration and innovation while expanding the platform's reach. By offering a managed service for it, you can tap into a revenue stream, catering to businesses seeking hassle-free deployment and support, thus leveraging the platform's popularity for sustainable growth.

# Stakeholder and user descriptions
